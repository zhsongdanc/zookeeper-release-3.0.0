/**
 * This class launches a standalone zookeeper server with JMX support
 * enabled. The users can connect to the server JVM and manage the server state 
 * (such as currently open client connections) and view runtime statistics using 
 * one of existing GUI JMX consoles (jconsole, for example). Please refer to 
 * the JDK vendor documentation for further information on how to enable JMX 
 * support in the JVM.
 * <p>
 * The server provides following MBeans:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Zookeeper server MBean -- provides various configuraton data and runtime 
 *  statistics, see {@link ZooKeeperServerMXBean}
 *  <li>Data tree MBean -- provides runtime data tree statistics, see 
 *  {@link DataTreeMXBean}
 *  <li>Client connection MBean -- provides runtime statistics as well as 
 *  connection management operations, see {@link ConnectionMXBean}
 * </ul>
 * The client connection is a dynamic resource and therefore the connection
 * MBeans are dynamically created and destroyed as the clients connect to and 
 * disconnect from the server.
